# DOTFILES
These are the dotfiles for my Arch Linux VM, running on a Microsoft Surface Pro 8 using Windows 11's HyperV.

## Compositor: X11
## Window manager: i3
## Bar: polybar
## Menu: rofi
## Terminal: alacritty
## Essential packages: 
- pywal
- lsd
- starship
- neovim
## Fonts:

Note: my usual install has the nvchad theme applied to neovim! I use the catppuccin theme.
# IMPORTANT!
My laptop has both a weird resolution (2880x1920) and a weird dpi value (192dpi); check in the various files to make sure that all the values are configured correctly and match your screen!
